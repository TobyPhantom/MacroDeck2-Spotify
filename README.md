so this smt i straight upc copied from chatGPT -um i mean built totaly by myself because i know what im doing and understand everything that this code does...
so basically its a redirect page for a spotify app thingy which i need for my MacroDeck
MacroDeck is an app that lets you use your phone as a stream deck, which is pretty neat
the only problem is that the spotifyplugin for it doesnt work anymore since you cant use localhost as a redirect anymore
so i asked chatgpt for help and it recommended this 
so yeah ...hope this works ig
